        <p>What makes good design? According to renowned German industrial designer Dieter Rams, good design should be functional, simple, and timeless. It is easy to understand, honest, and unobtrusive.</p>
        <p>I love these principles, but I'd extend them a bit further.</p>
        <p>Truly innovative design, I think, requires a kind of “cosmic vision,” eyes always on the search for lofty ideas that can uplift the human spirit and cause.</p>
        <p>It requires a sense of large scale significance. To improve our environment, we have to believe we are still in the beginning of changing the world—that we are in some final analysis responsible for its direction. </p>
        <p>Some say form follows function. Others — emotion. I would say both require vision. How should things work? How should we feel? We’ve got to produce an orientation, from our senses to our creations. There must be harmony between ideals and present day solutions. </p>
        <p>Vision, akin to hope, is what propels us forward amidst uncertainty and doubt. If we don't offer ours to the world, then something else will. And we can't be sure it will be as palatable.</p>
        <p>'Cosmic vision' means having a real respect for agency and greatness, an openness to be transformed by the work of others, and a firm trust in the ingenuity of our peers. It means not only recognizing and respecting genuis, but believing it can be reproduced in our work too.</p>
        <p>Our ability to see what is missing is what makes us human. Our ability to bring these things into reality is what makes us wonderful.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to garner vision is to ask hundred year questions. Instead of where the future of cars lie, ask: what does traffic look like in a hundred years? A world where we seldom ask why is a world much smaller than it should be.</p>
        <p>Every generation has a choice to go to the moon, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to measure and test its energies and skills.</p>
        <p>We cannot afford to forfeit ours.</p>
        <p>That's what it means to have cosmic vision. To be brave enough to try and provide good answers to the future. To think far. To feel responsible. </p>
