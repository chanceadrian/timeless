    <div class="p-grid">
        <p>Throughout history, humans have used art to explore our nature, contemplate the universe, and envision ideals.</p>
        <p>From cave paintings to classical sculptures and Renaissance masterpieces, fine art has allowed us to deliberate life’s greatest questions.</p>
        <p>Today, much of the creative energy of our era has shifted to new technology. Alluring machines now captivate our collective imagination. We are entranced by the potential of computation, the 21st century's Sistine Chapel.</p>
        <p>This allure is understandable.</p>
        <p>Technology promises to improve life and answer timeless questions about our world. But if not careful, we risk losing the childlike optimism and imagination that continually renew our appreciation for life.</p>
        <p>Like the greatest works of art, great technology, commits to a vision for the future. In every draft, a vote for the world we want to create and leave behind is made.</p>
        <p>And because the world has been moved by creative genius, we’ve got to make sure that any artist that wants to contribute, can.</p>
        <p>da Vinci, Gogh, Mozart, Picasso, and Dalí from a young age had access to usable tools. With just pen and paper, they explored their imaginations and the depths of their curiosity. These tools are timeless. Anyone at any age can use them.</p>
        <p>The 21st century tools we rely on to navigate of our lives is no longer pen, paper, or canvases. It is software. </p>
        <p>We have all used software that we love. Apps, notebooks, and browsers, which through several evolutions have become more personal, friendly, and easy to love.</p>
        <p>But what would a world look like if anyone, at any age, could create tools like these? What if software could be as personal to us as the items that hang on our walls and sit upon our shelves?</p>
        <p>Could your daughter come to you in the fourth grade, not with a finger painting, but with a game she developed in school that afternoon? Could she write her own word processor for high school? Her own application portal for university admission?</p>
        <p>What does software, the increasing medium of our lives, look like when it doesn't take a genius? </p>
        <p>If my daughter came to me with these questions, I could only say this:</p>
        <p>Think far, and stay foolish.</p>
